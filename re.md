# 6903 Course Examination Key Points Summary

## **Lecture 6/7: Risk Management**

### **(Already Covered in Part 1 - May Have Overlap)**

---

### **Core Definitions** (POTENTIAL QUESTIONS)

#### **What is the Difference Between Risk, Hazard, and Threat?**

**From Dictionary** - Not very well defined, but:

​**Hazard**​:

* A **physical concept**
* Has **no target**
* It is just there

​**Threat**​:

* Has a **specific target**
* A specific person can fall into that threat

​**Risk**​:

* A **mathematical concept**

​**HIRA**​:

* **Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment**
* One of the pillars of whole risk assessment

---

### **Risk Determination - Three Elements** (VERY IMPORTANT)

​**What Determines the Risk**​:

1. **Probability** - What is the probability it happens?
2. **Severity** - The impact
   * Air crash = very high impact
   * Probability has to be very small
   * Multiply them = acceptable risk
3. **Exposure** - Period of time
   * The more you're exposed to it, higher chance you will face the hazard
   * That's why probability includes ​**time element**​:
     * Per flight hour
     * Per flight
   * More time = probability of happening increases

---

### **Risk Assessment Matrix** (CRITICAL - WILL ASK)

​**This Chart Mentioned Many Times - Try and Understand**​:

​**Questions**​:

* What's meaning of ​**catastrophic**​?
* What's meaning of ​**number four**​?
* Is ​**number six acceptable**​?

​**The Chart**​:

* Probability × Severity
* Simplified for risk assessment
* This is the **Risk Assessment Matrix**

​**Matrix Variations**​:

* Some have only 3 elements (1-9 scale)
* **This one is 5 by 5** (equals 25)

​**Risk Element Interpretation**​:

* **Up to number 4** = Acceptable
* **Beyond number 4** = Must mitigate the risk
* **Number 10 and above** = Not allowed to be done (risk too high)

​**Three Categories**​:

1. **Acceptable**
2. **Review** - have to do something about it
3. **Unacceptable**

**Try to Understand This Chart - Potentially Could Ask Question**

---

### **Risk Classification Terms** (POTENTIAL QUESTIONS)

​**Definitions - Could Ask**​:

* What is ​**acceptable**​?
* What is ​**ALARP**​?

​**ALARP**​:

* **As Low As Reasonably Practicable**
* All these terms - could ask question

​**Question Type**​:

* Give you a **situation**
* Ask you to fit in: What situation is that?
* Sometimes a **situational question**

**Severity Levels** - Is it:

* A ​**major**​?
* A ​**minor**​?
* A ​**hazardous**​?

Can give a situation like that.

---

### **Risk Mitigation** (IMPORTANT)

​**ALARP is Actually Risk Mitigation**​:

* Not risk measurement
* Means you have to **reduce it to practical**
* Under risk mitigation

​**Potential Question**​: What do you do when risk is unacceptable?

​**Four Options**​:

1. **Change the design**
2. **Put physical guards**
3. **Put warning signs**
4. ​**Administrative control**​: Procedures and training

​**Example - 737 MAX**​:

* Risk is there, designed into it
* Supposed to have more training
* **They didn't do the training**
* Risk manifested into disaster
* Practical procedure and training = part of administrative control

---

### **Risk Factors** (POTENTIAL QUESTIONS)

​**Part of Dirty Dozen**​:

* Stress
* Lack of resources

​**Could Ask Question**​:

* Give you an example
* You identify which part of risk factor it is

---

### **Hidden Risk** (POTENTIAL QUESTION AREA)

​**Could Ask**​:

* What are the ​**hidden risks**​?
* What are the ​**increasing difficulty of detecting hidden risk**​?
* Where is it? ​**Organizational risk**​?

​**Looks Like This Chapter**​:

* All questions can be asked
* But **very conceptual**

---

### **Risk Factor Categories**

​**Could Identify**​:

* Human resource risk
* Technical human factors
* Environmental risk
* Operational risk
* Security risk

​**Common Sense Questions**​:

* Question can be asked
* You will know it once you see the answer

---

### **DAL - Design Assurance Level** (SOFTWARE - POTENTIAL QUESTION)

​**Software Design Assurance Level**​: A, B, C, D, E

​**Can Ask Question**​:

* What do you mean by catastrophic?
* Give you a situation
* Ask: Will this come into A, B, or C?

​**Not Difficult**​:

* Just understand the concept of DAL
* What are all these things about?

​**Meaning of**​:

* Catastrophic
* Hazardous
* Major
* Minor
* No effect

**Potentially Can Ask Question on That**

---

### **Risk Management Summary**

​**Very Theoretical**​:

* A lot of questions that can be asked
* Very conceptual

**Already Covered in Previous Test** (Numbering confusion):

* Chapter 6 was actually covered in previous one
* Some overlap with Chapter 7

​**Focus**​:

* Understanding definitions
* Risk assessment matrix
* Mitigation strategies
* Situational application

---

## **Lecture 8: Accident Investigation**

### **Four Questions Plus Case Study (Total 6 Questions)**

---

### **ICAO Annex 13** (VERY IMPORTANT)

#### **Who Can Be Involved in Accident Investigation?**

​**Key Parties**​:

1. **Country where aircraft crashed** = Leader of investigation team
2. **Manufacturer of aircraft** = Can send representative
3. **Airline** = Can send representative
4. **Aircraft registered country**
5. **Operator country**

**This is How ICAO Accident Investigation States**

**Who Has Right to Do All This?**

---

#### **Most Important Principle** (CRITICAL)

​**ICAO Statement**​:

> "The **sole objective** for investigation of an accident or incident is to ​**prevent accident and incident**​. It is ​**NOT to apportion blame or liability**​."

​**In ICAO Reports**​:

* First page will write this
* Means **cannot use this in legal case** to blame people or sue people

​**Reality**​:

* In theory: No blame
* In practice: Not like that
* A lot of law cases brought up many years later after release of investigation report

---

### **What Requires Investigation?** (POTENTIAL QUESTION)

​**Definition of Accident - Things That Require Investigation**​:

1. **Person seriously injured**
2. **Structural failure of aircraft**
3. **Aircraft missing or completely inaccessible**

​**Examples of Missing/Inaccessible**​:

* Aircraft crash into jungle or snow
* For many 10 years couldn't find it
* Example: **MH370** (missing)

​**These Are Things Can Ask**​:

* **Which of these determine what you call an investigation?**

---

### **Four Parties Involved** (STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION)

​**Accident Occurs - Who Involved?**​:

1. Aircraft where registered
2. Airline operator
3. Manufactured country
4. Country where accident occurred

​**Sometimes the Same**​:

* Aircraft registered + airline operator = normally same country
* Example: Singapore Airlines - all aircraft registered in Singapore

​**Not Necessary Always Same**​:

* ​**Strange Story Example**​:
  * Someone discovered loophole in financing
  * Register aircraft in America → get tax incentive
  * SIA registered 4 aircraft in America (9V registration)
  * Catch: Have to fly so many hours to America
  * After many years: Not worth it (scheduling problem)
  * But such strange things exist - airline owns aircraft but registered another country

---

### **Singapore's System** (STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION)

​**Singapore Party to ICAO**​:

* **MOT (Minister of Transport)** will lead investigation
* If accident happens in Singapore

​**Singapore Represented By**​:

* **AAIB** (Air Accident Investigation Bureau) or **TSIB** (Transport Safety Investigation Bureau)

**Will Ask This Kind of Question** - Straightforward question

---

### **During Investigation - Who Can Do What?**

​**Straightforward - Very Simple**​:

**All People Involved** (4 parties):

* Can send representative to investigation team
* Have all rights to:
  * Access to write site
  * Access to all documents

​**Reality**​:

* Once you are investigated officially
* Technically, sometimes their country will **block you from some information**

---

### **Accident Statistics Snapshot** (UNDERSTANDING TRENDS)

​**Accident Rates**​:

* Fatal accidents per million departures
* How many fatal accidents per million departures?

​**Historical Context**​:

* **Used to be 50** (at year one)
* **Used to be 40+** at this year one
* Loss of fatal accident, all accident rate
* Used to be 50 per year per million departure

​**Today**​:

* We are here (very low)
* **Last year's figure: 0.3**

​**Amazing Thing**​:

* Worried whether we can continue to hold these numbers

​**For Test**​: Won't ask this question about figures

---

### **What You Need to Understand**

​**Accident vs Incident**​:

* Understand what's an accident
* What's an incident
* Don't worry about one example of SQ system

---

### **Swiss Cheese Model** (IMPORTANT - POTENTIAL QUESTION)

​**James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model**​:

**Need to Know A Little Bit** - May ask question, but answers quite easy (very simple)

​**The Model**​:

**Layers of Defense** (All potential latent failures):

1. **Manufacturer** - Designed with some problems
2. **Regulation** - Safety net
3. **Airline Policy** - Operating procedures
4. **Maintenance Policy** - (Among airline policy) How much effort on maintenance defines defense
5. **Crew Training** - To prevent accidents
6. **Pilot** - **Final defense**

​**Purpose**​:

* We are **NOT pushing blame**
* Trying to analyze where, how to prevent next accident
* This is what James Reason Swiss Cheese Model tells you

---

### **Socio-Technical System** (ANOTHER MODEL)

**What Other Causes of Accident?**

​**Highest Level**​:

* System culture
* System climate

​**Example - Japan Airlines Recent Crash**​:

* Aircraft burned to bits
* **Nobody got hurt**
* Crew evacuated passengers perfectly

​**People Thinking**​:

* "Oh, crew is fantastic"

​**Reality**​:

* Crew of course fantastic
* But it's not just crew
* **It's the CULTURE**
* **Japan Airlines has very good safety culture**
* Which allowed crew to evacuate people without injury

​**These Are Kind of Things**​:

* Look at the climate
* Part of organization
* Communication and feedback

​**Enduring Reliability**​:

* Where **maintenance** is about (MRO)
* We are the one who take care, prevent a lot of accidents
* Arrested at maintenance part

---

### **Categories of Error** (FOR PROJECT PEOPLE)

​**Don't Have to Ask Detail**​:

* Not going to detail here
* Categories of error
* Maintenance errors
* Aircraft system errors

​**Some Statistics**​:

* Won't ask about statistics
* Statistics collected by James Reason actually
* Wouldn't ask figures (no point - can only read out figures)

​**More Asking on**​: Situation

---

### **Won't Ask About** (TOO DETAILED)

* Method - too detailed
* Who you should report to (part of ICAO system)
* Director of safety pilot
* Documents they found (detailed process of accident investigation)
* Emergency response (more for airport - search and rescue, salvage)

---

### **Direct vs Indirect Costs** (POTENTIAL QUESTION)

​**Could Ask**​:

* Identify a few things
* Tell me whether it's **direct cost** or **indirect cost**

**Potentially Can Do That**

---

### **Swiss Cheese Model Example**

​**Just an Example**​:

* Defense are not same
* Swiss Cheese Model - can invent our own
* Each of levels

​**In This Case Example**​:

* Line maintenance
* Psychological precursors (fatigue, etc.)
* Unsafe acts
* Inadequate defenses (more generic)

​**Inadequate Defenses Could Be**​:

* Pilot
* Pilot's training
* Maintenance

​**Model to Show**​:

* Accident causation

​**Won't Ask Detail**​:

* But **may ask question on case studies**
* Very important accidents

---

### **Case Studies** (POTENTIAL QUESTIONS)

#### **Don't Worry About Pictures** - No questions

#### **The Story Focus**

​**May Ask Questions on Cases**​:

* What you have learned from it
* Not detail where you have to remember things
* If you understand it, you'll be able to find answer

---

### **Kegworth Crash** (Potential Question)

​**This Crash Has A Lot Of**​:

* Latent error
* Active error
* **Bad blatant violation**

​**Could Ask**​:

* Put in one of the categories
* Decide whether it's a **violation** or not

​**See the Violations**​:

* **Tire done 37 landings** - Normally should change at 25 (violation of process)
* **Aircraft 1,200 kg overweight** (violation of process)
* So many violations
* Aircraft weight 6 tons over
* So many violations
* Center of gravity shifted
* Half of max limit
* Aircraft trim was a bit of problem

​**You Can See**​:

* Kegworth had so many violations

---

### **Alaska Airlines 501** (Case Study)

​**This Case**​:

* Has quite a bit of violation

​**Pilots Actions**​:

* Actually did wrong thing by pulling circuit breaker

​**Question**​:

* Why did they do it?
* Was there training deficiency?
* Was there a lapse?
* **May NOT be violation**
* He's doing it with intent to solve problem
* He has **lapse** - didn't realize pulling circuit breaker can cause plane to crash

---

### **Weather and Other Details** (Don't Worry)

* Don't worry about weather stories
* These are just details
* Not much to learn about
* Won't ask question on detail of this

---

### **Indian Crash - Recent 787** (Not Conclusive)

​**Potential Question**​:

* Whether the major cause
* Main cause of each of this accident
* Could ask question on that

---

### **Cases We Went Through** (Review)

​**Did We Go Through These?**​:

* AHA 243
* C16

​**Some of These**​:

* Can put scenario to you
* Tell you which part of Swiss Cheese Model
* Or what is high accountability

---

### **Conspiracy Theories** (Don't Worry)

* Just conspiracy theory whatever

---

### **Accident Investigation Summary**

​**Not Difficult to Ask 4 Questions**​:

* All very closely related

​**Different from 6902**​:

* 6902 very fragmented, pieces of information everywhere
* **6903 all linked together**
* In a way, **easier to ask questions**

---

## **Lecture 9/10: Aviation Security**

### **Put Number 9 and 10 Together**

---

### **Historical Context** (Understanding Background)

​**A Little Bit Historical in Sense**​:

* Very difficult to ask question on this
* Talking about all history of crash in early days

---

### **Early Days Hijacking - Cuba Era** (IMPORTANT CONCEPT)

​**Since Got Some Time - Story**​:

​**The Early Days**​:

* All hijackers go to **Cuba**
* If you want to board aircraft, you say "Cuba" → they arrest you straight away
* In the 1960s

​**Why Cuba?**​:

* Cuba is a **sanctuary for criminals**
* American cannot go into Cuba and arrest them
* American criminals will **hijack plane to Cuba**

​**The Change**​:

* Later, Cuba government felt too many American criminals in their country
* They signed **extradition agreement** with United States
* Before: No extradition - prisoner lands in Cuba, he's free to go

​**Impact**​:

* After they signed extradition
* **Statistic dropped straight away**
* Post-1973: Agreement signed → dropped to near zero immediately

---

### **Early Hijacking Characteristics** (IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING)

​**In Early Days**​:

* **Hijacking was NOT political**
* Sometimes political, sometimes for personal reason
* Just want to get out of country

​**Most of Time**​:

* Just somebody wants to get out
* **NOT a terrorist act**
* **No intention to hurt people**
* Just want to hijack plane as **transport to get out of country**

**Can See Up to Here**

---

### **9/11 as Turning Point** (CRITICAL CONCEPT)

​**Subsequently**​:

* **9/11 is a very important juncture**
* **9/11 changed the whole route**

​**9/11 Was**​:

* **Terrorist act** who used aircraft as weapon
* **Intent was to kill people**

​**Before 9/11**​:

* It was not

**Can Distinguish These Two Differences**

---

### **Era of Hijacking** (STATISTICAL UNDERSTANDING)

​**Looking at Cuba Era**​:

* 1961-1972 (11-12 years)
* Over 160 hijackings to Cuba
* **60% of all global hijacking goes to Cuba**

**Can See the Pattern**

​**Those Are Not Important for Test**​:

* But for those doing security project
* These are important statistics

​**They Are**​:

* Criminals
* NOT political refugees

​**After '73**​:

* Thing stopped

---

### **Real Terrorist Acts - Post 9/11** (FOCUS AREA)

​**Let's Look at Real Terrorist Acts**​:

* Started from 9/11

​**There Are A Lot**​:

* Aircraft not just hijacked
* They were **destroyed** actually

​**The Reason**​:

* **Middle Eastern conflict** up to today
* **Palestinian issue**

​**Nearly All Terrorist Acts on Aircraft**​:

* Were through Palestinian issue

​**Exception**​:

* One in Singapore
* Not Palestinian issue
* Another political issue

---

### **Types of Hijacking** (POTENTIAL QUESTION)

​**All These Are Hijacking**​:

* Hezbollah - all Palestinian related

​**Ransom Hijacking**​:

* Want to hijack to get money
* ​**Famous Case**​: D.B. Cooper
  * Demanded \$200,000 and parachutes
  * Jumped down
  * Never found actually

---

### **Media Attention Problem** (UNDERSTANDING CONCEPT)

​**Problem with Terrorism**​:

* Attracts a lot of **media attention**
* News, TV love all these things

​**What Happened?**​:

* Once in media → **copycat behavior**
* People follow same pattern

​**Today**​:

* They stopped doing that
* Purposely don't want to publicize terrorist acts
* Newspaper will not flesh out
* **Actually very effective - it worked**

---

### **Motivation for Hijacking** (IMPORTANT - POTENTIAL QUESTION)

​**Could Be Question Asked**​:

* **Kind of hijack that happened in past**

​**Types**​:

1. **Extortion**
2. **Political asylum**
3. **Ransom**
4. **Mentally disabled** - a few cases of mentally disturbed hijackers

​**Most Important Thing**​:

* **Motivation for hijack are different over the age**

---

### **Why Hijacking Decreased Recently** (INTERESTING INSIGHT)

​**Discussion with CAAS People Over Dinner**​:

​**Someone Asked**​:

* Do you realize during last 5 years, very little hijacking of aircraft?
* Think 5-10 years - hardly any

**Why?**

​**Before (Year 2000)**​:

* Terrorists hijacked American aircraft
* Why? America held **biggest aircraft fleet** and airline business
* More than 50%
* Terrorists wanted to **attack America aviation industry**

​**Today**​:

* **Arab countries own significant number** of aviation industry
* Just make sense to use aircraft → **hurt themselves**

​**Can See**​:

* All these **political and psychological factors** can affect airline security

---

### **Won't Ask Questions On** (TOO DETAILED)

* Detail of each of these
* Just go through

​**May Ask**​:

* A few on **motivation of terrorists**

---

### **Post-9/11 Security Measures** (UNDERSTANDING IMPACT)

​**From 9/11 Reality**​:

* Aircraft become a **weapon**
* Not just transportation
* Suicide missions as well

​**Important Thing**​: After 9/11, what do you do?

​**Started to Make**​:

* In those days: Anybody can walk into cockpit and talk to captain
* After 9/11: Make **very strong door** that you cannot break into
* From that on: **Cannot walk into cockpit - locked all the time**

**That Is the Impact**

---

### **Recent Problems** (CONTRADICTIONS)

​**Recently**​:

* MH370
* **German Wings** - deranged pilot locked door and crashed plane

​**Now the Opposite**​:

* People say: "How come made door so difficult?"
* But that was the intent because of 9/11

​**Can Say**​:

* At each phase, **security game has changed**

**Just to Let You Know What Happened** - all during my time

* Can tell you all these things

---

### **Question Focus** (MORE ON)

​**Could Ask**​:

* More the **motivation**
* What has happened on aircraft

---

### **Airport Security** (WON'T ASK A LOT)

* Wouldn't ask lot of questions on that
* Quite obvious targets

---

### **Aircraft Maintenance Facility** (IMPORTANT VULNERABILITY)

​**This is Important**​:

​**Scenario**​:

* Aircraft in hangar for 1 month
* Very easy to **sabotage aircraft**

​**Have Seen Cases**​:

* Aircraft in hangar has wire cut
* We knew someone purposely cut
* **Luckily discovered**
* Not our aircraft - somebody else's aircraft

​**All These Things**​:

* Can sabotage:
  * Tires
  * Hydraulics
* All exposed, vulnerable to tampering

​**Because of Large Workforce**​:

* In hangar: 100 people working
* Quite often employ:
  * Foreigners
  * Contract workers

---

### **Today's Security**

​**Very Hard to Get Into Hangar**​:

* Used to: Can walk into hangar anytime, middle of night
* Just walk up to aircraft

​**Now**​:

* Even **CEO of Singapore Airlines cannot go to SIAEC** and walk into hangar
* Because of all security
* Really, very, very **cumbersome**

---

### **Prevention Measures** (WON'T ASK DETAILS)

​**All These Prevention**​:

* Won't ask details on all these things

​**More Importantly**​:

* Will ask questions on:
  * **Motivation of hijacking**
  * **Why people hijack**
  * **Why certain kind of hijack disappearing**
  * **Why different motivation happening**

​**Won't Ask All Details**​:

* Except maybe 1-2 questions on **Singapore hijack** (have lot of detail on that)

---

### **Cyber Security Threat** (DISPUTED CLAIM)

​**Important Thing**​:

* Security researcher claimed hacked aircraft
* Through in-flight entertainment system
* Through seat electronics

​**I Disputed That**​:

* Cannot control aircraft
* Same as MH370

​**Conspiracy**​:

* Someone says Ukrainian went into electronic bay
* Plugged in computer and hijacked aircraft
* Even very senior people think possible

​**I Told Them NO**​:

* Not possible
* Software for:
  * Control aircraft
  * Information of aircraft in-flight entertainment
* **Totally segregated**
* Technically **not possible** this guy claimed all these things

---

### **Aircraft Repair Station Security** (BUSINESS IMPACT)

​**Now Become Serious Problem**​:

​**Americans Insist**​:

* If want to repair American aircraft
* Have to have this security

​**Turned Out Good for Us**​:

* We are the one who could impose this security
* Prove to Americans our security good enough

​**Many Airline MRO Companies**​:

* Not able to do that

​**Result**​:

* **Increases our business** of American aircraft
* Very interesting turn of event

​**Telling This**​:

* But not test questions

---

### **Third Party Threat** (SERIOUS)

**Third Party is Serious Threat**

​**Strange Things**​:

* When aircraft goes to hangar in those days
* Nobody cares
* Anybody can do anything they want

​**Story - King of Jordan**​:

* Aircraft belonged to King of Jordan landed in hangar
* His bed inside aircraft - **gold plated**
* Whole everything gold plated
* Guy took out bed to repair aircraft
* Left it in hangar

​**Someone Said**​:

* "Hey, can't do this - all gold plated"
* Brought bed to my workshop (I was running workshop, quite big space)

​**Never Forgot That Incident**​:

* Actually had King of Jordan's bed inside workshop
* Should have taken picture and lied over there
* Never thought of that

​**This is How Maintenance Worked in Past**​:

* Very loose
* Nobody even care there's golden bed sitting out there

---

### **Response of Repair Stations**

​**Now Has to Set**​:

* A lot of security rules

---

### **Security Questions Summary**

​**Let's Move On**​:

* Many airlines
* Bit difficult to ask questions on security

​**Probably**​:

* Let me see how many questions ask you
* **Not much questions** on this

---

## **Singapore Hijacking Case Study** (IMPORTANT - MAY ASK)
